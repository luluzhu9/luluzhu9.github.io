I'm a *3rd year Computer Science major* at the **University of California, San Diego** minoring in *Cognitive Science*.
~~Mistaken Text~~

I also have a [Design Portfolio](https://www.luluzhu.com/) in the works.

One interesting quote from a book I read recently is:
> Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope.

Some libraries I've dabbled in are:
```
React.JS
Angular.JS
Canvas.JS
```

Some of my hobbies are:
- Art and crafts
  - I've been cross-stiching a lot recently
  - And getting back into painting and sketching
- Baking
- Working out
  - Slowly getting back into it!

Some music genres I enjoy are:
1. Rnb
2. Rap
3. Edm

Some new years resolutions for 2021:
- [ ] Rediscover old hobbies like reading
- [ ] Get more into fashion
- [ ] Develop career more
